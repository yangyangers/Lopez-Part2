		<p id="p2">In my <b><i>"Elementary Days"</i></b>, i was the most punctual student in our class. When i was at grade 4 to 5 i joined MTAP classes every saturday so that my learnings in mathematics will advance. At Grade 6, i joined Girls Scout because our adviser is a Girls Scout Leader so we have no choice but to join, but it was awesome experience especially during the campfire. thats is the thing i can share during elementaryu days, cause i don't remember some moments.</p>
